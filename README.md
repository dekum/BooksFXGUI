## OverView
<p> This program will allow the user to access a database called "books" and then the user will able to cycle through the rows of that "Author Table". This program exhibits how to connect to a database, how to display results from a databaset to a JavaFx window and basic functionality of buttons in Javafx.</p>

Included here is a picture of the screen when the database is properly connected. The previous button is selectable here, but is disabled by default. The Next button is selectable when connection is successfully, it moves the resultset to the next row of the table

And this is a gif of the program running successfully. You can see how the next and the previous button function properly.
